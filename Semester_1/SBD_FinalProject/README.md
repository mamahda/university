# Database System Final Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates key concepts in database systems, focusing on creating tables, manipulating data, and querying a relational database. The database is designed based on the Physical Data Model (PDM), which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mamahda/SBD-FinalProject/blob/main/img/PDM.jpg).

## Key Features

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:  
  - Creating tables, defining primary and foreign keys.
  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:  
  - Inserting, updating, and deleting data.

- **SQL Queries**:  
  - Writing queries to retrieve data using `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, etc.

## PDM Diagram

The PDM diagram provides a visual representation of the database schema. You can view it [here](https://github.com/mamahda/SBD-FinalProject/blob/main/img/PDM.jpg).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a relational database, perform data manipulation, and run queries to retrieve useful information.
